/*
Check if one string is rotation of another

Problem Statement: Given two strings s and goal, return true if and only if s can become goal after some number of shifts on s.
A shift on s consists of moving the leftmost character of s to the rightmost position. For example, if s = "abcde", then it will be "bcdea" after one shift.
Examples
Example 1:
Input:
 s = "rotation", goal = "tionrota"
Output:
 true
Explanation:
 After multiple left shifts on "rotation", we get:
    1st shift → "otationr"
    2nd shift → "tationro"
    3rd shift → "ationrot"
    4th shift → "tionrota"
    So the goal string can be obtained by rotating the original string.

Example 2:
Input:
 s = "hello", goal = "lohelx"
Output:
 false
Explanation:
 
Even after all possible rotations of "hello", we cannot form "lohelx" due to the presence of an extra character 'x'. Hence, it's not possible.

        for (int i = 0; i < s.size(); i++) {
            if (s == goal) return true;
            rotate(s.begin(), s.begin() + 1, s.end());
        }
        return false;
    }
